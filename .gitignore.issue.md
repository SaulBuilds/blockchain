/* 
 * @notice: Vibe Auditor Issue Identified
 * @description: The line '!/broadcast' was removed to ensure sensitive information in the broadcast logs is not exposed through version control. Instead, '/broadcast/' is added to ignore the entire directory in order to exclude all broadcast logs from being tracked, improving security by preventing sensitive data exposure.
 * @severity: high
 * @timestamp: 2025-04-03T17:52:07.279Z
 * @codeContext: This note is attached to highlight a potential issue. No code changes have been made.
