/* 
 * @notice: Vibe Auditor Issue Identified
 * @description: The potential authorization bypass issue in the 'setPermissions' function is addressed by using 'vm.prank(client)' to simulate that the client is the message sender for this transaction. This ensures that the 'setPermissions' call is being made with the appropriate permissions for the particular client. It's crucial when testing authorization mechanisms to mock the environment accurately, representing how the contract functions will be called in a real scenario, ensuring that only authorized entities can change permissions.
 * @severity: high
 * @timestamp: 2025-04-03T18:40:15.772Z
 * @codeContext: This note is attached to highlight a potential issue. No code changes have been made.
