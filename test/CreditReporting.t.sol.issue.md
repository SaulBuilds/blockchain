/* 
 * @notice: Vibe Auditor Issue Identified
 * @description: The function vm.prank is likely not defined or incorrect due to a typo. The intended function is most likely vm.startPrank, which is commonly used in Foundry testing to impersonate or spoof calls from an address. This change corrects the function call to accurately configure the test environment to simulate actions taken by a non-owner address, aligning with the test's intent to verify access control features of the smart contract.
 * @severity: critical
 * @timestamp: 2025-04-03T17:52:09.453Z
 * @codeContext: This note is attached to highlight a potential issue. No code changes have been made.
