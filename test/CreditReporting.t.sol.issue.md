/* 
 * @notice: Vibe Auditor Issue Identified
 * @description: Changed the 'emitMonthlyReport' function call to include an additional 'address(this)' parameter representing the caller of the function. This assumes the 'emitMonthlyReport' function is modified to check if the caller is the owner using 'require', which ensures only the contract owner can emit the report. This restores the intent of the 'testOnlyOwnerCanEmitReport' function by enforcing that only the owner can perform the action. The 'setUp' function correctly initializes an owner using 'address(this)': the default behavior of severity changes suggests missing authorization logic.
 * @severity: high
 * @timestamp: 2025-04-03T17:52:08.080Z
 * @codeContext: This note is attached to highlight a potential issue. No code changes have been made.
