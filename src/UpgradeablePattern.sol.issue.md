/* 
 * @notice: Vibe Auditor Issue Identified
 * @description: Added 'onlyOwner' modifier to the 'upgrade' function to restrict access to only the contract owner. This modification ensures that only authorized personnel can upgrade the contract implementation, mitigating unauthorized changes and potential security risks. The 'onlyOwner' modifier assumes the contract implements access control, such as Ownable from OpenZeppelin, which should also include the necessary modifier logic to check for ownership.
 * @severity: high
 * @timestamp: 2025-04-03T18:40:14.999Z
 * @codeContext: This note is attached to highlight a potential issue. No code changes have been made.
